# Investigate-the-TMDB-dataset
Project 1 from the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree

## Overview of the dataset:
In this project I will use a TMBD dataset, The Movie Database (TMDb), that contains information about more than 10 000 movies all over the years since 1960 and until 2015.
During the project I will analyse and do several changes in order to clean data and make it useful for the analysis. I will also create new dataframes and relate them with the origininal. All steps of the cleaning and analysis of the data will be explained along the project.

## Summary of Findings

Popularity has had ups and downs over the years but most recentyly there is an increase in populariry levels, maybe because of digitalization and social networks that are very useful to promote movies. 

The number of movies released per increased over time but more significantly from 2005/2006. 

The most released genre is Drama, followed by Comedy and Thriller but the most profitable is Animation. The genre with better ratings is Documentary, although is one of the less populars.

In terms of more release movies, I found the following top 5:
Directos: Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott.
Production companies: Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Columbia Pictures.
Actors: Robert de Niro, Samuel L.Jackson, Bruce Wilis, Nicolas Cage and Miachael Caine.

In terms of financial results, the top 5 are:
Biggest Budget: The Warrior's Way, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Superman Returns and Titanic.
Biggest Renevue: Avatar, Star Wars, Titanic, The Exorcist and Jaws.
I found a moderate positive correlation between budget and revenue.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I found that the number of movies released have been increasing over time, specially from mid 2000's.
Ratings and popularity are not directly related as the most well rated genre in one of the less popular: documentary.
